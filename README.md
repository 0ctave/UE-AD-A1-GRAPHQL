## How to dockerize ?

Run ```docker-compose up -d```
This will launch all the services on their respective ports
To launch test run ```python3 test/main.py```
All other tests need to be done by hand

## Services list :

| Service  | Port |
|----------|------|
| movie    | 3001 |
| booking  | 3002 |
| user     | 3004 |
